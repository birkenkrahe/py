\maketitle
This four-week course is designed to provide students with a
comprehensive introduction to programming in Python, covering
fundamental concepts and practical applications of the language. Using
"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes as the textbook, students will
learn how to install Python and an IDE, and get started with basic
data types, control flow statements, functions, files, and
exceptions. They will also gain hands-on experience with more advanced
topics such as object-oriented programming, modules and packages,
testing and debugging, and data analysis and visualization.

The second half of the course will focus on game development with the
Pygame library, starting with basic game framework development and
gradually building up to a fully functional "space invaders" game. In
addition, students will learn how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to
create visualizations for data analysis, and how to use Pandas to
manipulate and analyze data.

Throughout the course, students will have ample opportunity to
practice their programming skills with a variety of exercises and
projects. They will also receive guidance and feedback from the
instructor on their progress and final projects. By the end of the
course, students should have a solid foundation in Python programming
and be able to apply their skills to a wide range of projects, from
game development to data analysis and visualization. This course is
ideal for anyone with little or no programming experience who wants to
learn Python or for those who have some experience in programming and
want to learn more advanced concepts and practical applications.
