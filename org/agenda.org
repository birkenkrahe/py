- [X] Go to Canvas ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1700][lyon.instructure.com]])
- [X] Open Zoom ([[https://lyon-edu.zoom.us/j/85828233316][lyon-edu.zoom.us/j/85828233316]])
- [X] Entry *survey* - [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yz2EtuSin3r54zMG1d_JCnnVAGb0XI8cP-Yvr7FmZbo/edit#responses][review of your responses]].
  - What is the OS and why is it relevant to programming?
  - What is the command line and why is it important?
  - Which languages do you already know (10!): FORTRAN, Visual BASIC,
    SQL, R, Stata, Java, C#, Python,C,Lua
  - Topics wanted: 1) *webscraping*, 2) *Machine learning*, 3) Cybersecurity[fn:1]
  - Tools: VS Code/Emacs IDEs known
  - Terror: I will never show up drunk (in class or anywhere)
  - Time: 120 min in class, 180 min outside of class (per day)
    1) class: 15 min check in and review
    2) class: 90 min lecture + practice
    3) class: 15 min summary, questions, outlook
    4) home: 30-90 min DataCamp + 60-120 min revision/assignments
- [ ] Course *overview* - assignments, grading, topics, platforms.
- [ ] *Practice:* a first (literate) Python program & platforms.
- [ ] First *assignment*: "Getting started in Python" @DataCamp.

** In-class summary

- The terminal allows the user to communicate with the OS.
- Python comes in different versions.
- Python (and all apps) need to be built/compiled for an OS.
- Microsoft (and others) combines technical and commercial interests.
- Python [the interpreter] is written in C.
- There are (many) different layers of software between user and
  machine (which leads to greater usability/lower performance).

** Homework
- Register with GitHub, DataCamp, replit.com
- Get access to Canvas for materials and for Zoom

[fn:1]Webscraping Excel manipulation and Machine Learning are already
part of my plan, but cybersecurity is currently not included (except
indirectly through the command line and string manipulation skills).
