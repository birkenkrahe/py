- A math app that you cannot cheat with - an honor math app
- A resource matching app: e.g. match labor supply with demand (really
  efficiently), possibly including a market and negotiation engine
- A game where the world generates itself as soon as you reach the end
  of it including quest lines, NPCs
- An Internet Wayback machine without the snags where you can retrieve
  a version of a website fast and very granularly
- A script that can reach into SQL and pull values out of a column to
  monitor daily changes in the columns, e.g. money

#+begin_quote
My infinite skills Python projects:
1. An application that lets students know which remote or in-person
   data science internships are currently available in the USA.
2. An application that predicts cancer risk from medical images with
   no false negatives (i.e. images that show cancer but were not
   labeled as such).
3. An application that shows me the (publicly available) syllabi of
   all courses (world-wide) with the title and content of my upcoming
   courses.
4. An application that provides real-time insight into Lyon College
   data, especially retention, grade average, finance, incoming
   students, alumni vs. visitor data.
5. An application that finds funding opportunities, pre-fills them
   with available data (publications, personal, location) and
   identifies next steps.
6. An application based on a speech assistant coupled with a
   conversational chat bot that submits: early alerts, grades,
   summaries after each class as announcements.

** Day review (and test preview)
#+attr_latex: :width 300px
#+caption: Family packing fruit, Sydneay 1911 (Flickr.com)
[[../img/review.jpg]]

/We review yesterday's material. These questions will resurface in the
weekly multiple-choice tests, i.e. you can use this to prepare./

1) What's a computer terminal?
   - A window to communicate with the Operating System (OS)
   - A command line interface (CLI)
   - A place to enter shell commands (like ~cd~)

2) What are three strengths and three weaknesses of Python?
   | STRENGTH                     | WEAKNESS                |
   |------------------------------+-------------------------|
   | Easy to learn and to read    | Performance (speed)     |
   | Data science applications    | Significant indentation |
   | Automation and small scripts | Platform requirements   |

3) What language is the Python interpreter written in?
   #+begin_quote
   Answer: in the C programming language (which allows programming
   'close to the machine' (making full use of its resources).
   #+end_quote

4) What are we going to use Schoology for in this course?
   #+begin_quote
   Answer: for nothing. We use the Canvas learning management system,
   GitHub, DataCamp, replit.com, IDLE and Google Colaboratory.
   #+end_quote

5) What's our policy regarding the use of AI coding assistants?
   #+begin_quote
   Answer: it's allowed as long as you reference and document your
   use.
   #+end_quote

6) What does Google Colab provide but Python's IDLE does not?
   #+begin_quote
   Answer: An interactive notebook
   #+end_quote

7) What's the difference between a compiled language (for example C)
   vs. an interpreted language (for example Python or R)?
   #+begin_quote
   - Compiler: Human-readable source code is compiled to a
     machine-readable file that needs to be executed for results.
   - Interpreter: source code is read and executed line by line at
     runtime, and no executable file is produced.
   - Both compiler and interpreter are specific to the underlying
     computer architecture.
   #+end_quote

- Windows' Command Line Interface: finding and opening the terminal,
  prompt, absolute/relative path, root and file tree, CLI commands and
  options; ~cd~, ~python~, ~ls~, ~whoami~.
- Python's IDLE: interactive shell ~>>>~, getting ~help()~ and finding
  documentation; Python keywords, symbols and modules (libraries).
- Python's file editor: printing a greeting in Python (hello world)
  with ~print~. Default arguments. Comments (~#~), ~.py~ file types,
  debugger and traceback. Keyboard interrupt (~CTRL + c~).
- Literate programming: weaving documentation and tangling source code
  from a literate file that contains text + code + output. With Emacs:
  one document with code in < 44 languages.
- Google's Colab: code and text cells, scratch cell, GDrive backup,
  GitHub gist export, auto-completion, interactive notebooks with
  IPython (~.ipynb~), ~matplotlib~ and ~numpy~ modules. ~import~, lineplot
  with ~pyplot~. Colab dashboard. Markdown with ~#~ (headline).

* DONE Day 3: Infrastructure practice II: DataCamp, REPL
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Obituary page for Jason Anderson (willisfs.com)
[[../img/jason.png]]

Change of plans: *We will *not meet in class on Thursday, 24 May*. I'd
like to be able to attend both the visitation and the memorial service
for Jason Anderson ([[https://www.willisfs.com/obituary/Jason-Anderson][â€ ]]) myself tomorrow from 1 pm - 3 pm (Brown
Chapel).

Instead, please work through the remainder of the practice file
(handout and [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/blob/main/pdf/0_course_practice.pdf][here on GitHub]]) *on your own*. Both sessions can be done
online from the comfort of your home:
1) Open a browser with two windows, and work through the exercises for
   replit.com and DataCamp workspaces line by line.
2) Essentially, both environments offer file editor + interactive
   Python shell + OS shell in one window.
3) Replit.com is more like IDLE, while the DataCamp workspace is an
   interactive notebook like Colab.
4) Python-wise, this is essentially "hello world" again.

This shouldn't take more than an hour. Use the remaining time to get
started with your [[https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-spring-2023/assignments][DataCamp assignments]] (15 chapters in total,
requiring no less than 15 hours of practice).

In the middle of our taking off for flight, it might be worthwhile
highlighting some logistics to help you review past sessions if you so
choose:

1) You can find the *session review/test preview* information, and a
   summary of the last session in the agenda file here in GitHub
   ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/blob/main/pdf/agenda.pdf][PDF]] or [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/blob/main/org/agenda.org][HTML]]).
2) You can find all *practice and lecture files* in the PDF directory
   here in GitHub ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/tree/main/pdf][PDF]] or [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/tree/main/org][HTML]]): I just went through it myself to
   review today.
3) Lastly, photos of the *whiteboard* writings and drawings are
   available [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IEkIHzieBJ_tS5GPigsCxRZcioanlPof?usp=sharing][here in GDrive]].

I'm looking forward to seeing you on Friday to cover Python
expressions, variables and statements with more practice exercises.

Any questions, you know where to find me!

Cheers

/We review yesterday's material. These questions will resurface in the
weekly multiple-choice tests, i.e. you can use this to prepare./

1) What's the difference between an absolute and a relative path?
   #+begin_quote
   Answer: The *absolute* path always begins at the root directory, the
   origin of the file tree (e.g. ~C:\~ on Windows, or ~/~ on Linux), while
   the *relative* path specifies a location relative to your current
   directory (~PWD~).
   #+end_quote

2) You know 4 different Python shells already - which are they?
   #+begin_quote
   - The interactive Python shell in IDLE (~>>>~)
   - The IPython code cell in Google Colab (~[1]~)
   - The console in replit.com ~>~
   - The shell opened in a terminal with the ~python~ command
   #+end_quote

3) Which features does the IPython shell (e.g. in a Colab code cell)
   have?
   #+begin_quote
   - Auto-completion of keywords like ~print~ and user-defined variables
   - Integration of pre-installed modules like ~matplotlib~ for plotting
   #+end_quote

4) Are your Google Colab notebooks saved anywhere?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, they are automatically saved in the ~Colab Notebooks~ directory
   in your Google drive (~w:\My Drive\~ on Windows @Lyon).
   #+end_quote

5) What can you do with the ~#~ symbol?
   #+begin_quote
   - Comment lines in a ~.py~ Python file
   - Comment on the interactive Python shell
   - Create headlines in a Colab text cell ("markdown markup")
   #+end_quote

6) What does DataCamp workspace offer?
   #+begin_quote
   - Linux shell
   - Interactive Python console
   - Python file editor
   - Interactive Jupyter notebook
   - plus a few JupyterLab gadgets (launcher)

of the "Introduction to Python" course on DataCamp (you can practice).

Please note the (new) [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1700/assignments][deadlines for the three DataCamp courses]]. These
courses amount to 60% of the home assignment grade. The remaining
points will come from 8 programming assignments (like "word count").

*** Using Anaconda

Jonathan Tucker: If you need a different Python version for running a
program (that requires a specific version) what application would you
use to create this? I need to be able to run the newest version of
Python and switch between the older version seamlessly.  I'm looking
at using Conda to give the program its own Python environment (with
the correct version), does this make sense?

Answer: Yes this does make sense. Anaconda may be overkill though -
you ought to be aware of the bare metal alternative which is Python's
virtualenv. The purpose is not so much to switch between versions fast
but to have different environments for your production code. If you're
a lone developer though why not just have different versions on your
machine. I do that with R all the time (whenever I upgrade), and R (or
Emacs) allow me to call upon any version when I want to. So I would
probably give virtualenv a try if I had to. Currently, I have 3.11 and
3.9 on Windows, 3.8 on Ubuntu, but all of them still on the same
PC. Here is a recent comparison of the two:
https://dataaspirant.com/anaconda-python-virtualenv/. Or what I would
probably do is write a shell script that uses one command (python) and
switches between different versions. If you use Conda, you will not
understand how it's done. If you use virtualenv, you understand a
little more (it requires knowledge of the file tree at least, and
environment variables), and if you write your own scripts, you're tha
master of the universe :-) (However, if you ask me "send me that
script" I'd have to do some research first.) Hope this helps.

[[../img/summary.jpg]]

- An instruction that evaluates to a single value is an
  *expression*. An instruction that doesn't is a *statement*.
- Data types are: integer (~int~), floating-point (~float~), string (~str~)
- Strings hold text and begin and end with quotes: ~â€˜Hello world!'~
- Strings can be concatenated (~+~) and replicated (~*~)
- Values can be stored in variables: ~spam = 42~
- Variables can be used anywhere where values can be used in
  expressions: ~spam + 1~
- Variable names: one word, letters, numbers (not at beginning),
  underscore only

- [X] User interaction: Keyboard input, error and output
- [X] Functions: getting help, arguments, parameters
- [X] The caret operator in Python and the binary function
- [ ] Three problems: string replication, splitting, math constants

** The caret ~^~ operator in Python

- Use ~**~ for exponentiation and not ~^~ (as in R). In Python, the caret
  operator ~^~ is the binary ~XOR~ operator: it compares two binary
  numbers and returns a binary with bits set to 1 where the
  corresponding bits of the operations differ:
  #+begin_src python :results output
    print(2**4)   # prints 16
    print(2^4)    # prints 6...?
    print('binary: ', bin(2)[2:])   # binary for 2
    print('binary: ', bin(4)[2:])   # binary for 4
    print('binary: ', bin(6)[2:])   # binary for 6

*** PDF scraping
For those who are interested: following up from Radek's question about
PDF meta data extraction (author, affiliation), I played around a
little and came up with this:
https://gist.github.com/birkenkrahe/8b958852165982daa8501014127c23d7 -
I didn't find it easy (HTML is textual markup, not binary, and much
more forgiving) but I learnt something. At the top there is a link to
a book which I did not read or use (it's from 2018 and the package I
used was PyPDF4 and not PyPDF2).

** Preview and review

1) What does the expression ~str(int(age) + 1)~ do?
   #+begin_quote
   [[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/eval/3-4.html][Here is an HTML animation]] (Sweigart, 2023)
   #+end_quote
   1) ~age~ is string ~input~
   2) ~int(age)~ converts the string to a number - you cannot do that
      with any character like "a": ~int("a")~ throws an error. To convert
      characters to their Unicode standard, you need to use ~ord~:
      #+begin_src python
        print(int("25"))
        print(ord("a"))
        print(ord("A"))
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 25
      : 97
      : 65
   3) ~int(age) + 1~ adds 1 to whatever number ~int(age)~ evaluates to:
      #+begin_src python
        age = "25"
        print(age)
        print(age + " years old")
        print(int(age))
        print(int(age)+1)
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 25
      : 25 years old
      : 25
      : 26
   4) ~str(int(age) + 1)~ converts the result to a string:
      #+begin_src python
        age = "25"
        print(age)
        print(age + " years old")
        print(int(age))
        print(int(age)+1)
        print(str(int(age)+1))
        print(str(int(age)+1) + " years old")
      #+end_src

2) What do you get when you type ~ord?~ on the Python console (~>>>~)?
   #+begin_quote
   A ~SyntaxError~ because ~?~ is an IPython shell command only.
   #+end_quote

3) What does the dot-operator do, e.g. in ~str.split~?
   #+begin_quote
   The dot-operator ~.~ is an /accessor/: it allows you to access anything
   that's stored inside an object, e.g. the /string/ class ~str~, or an
   instance of that class, a particular string: e.g. ~'three'.count('')~
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src python :results output
     print('three'.count(''))   # count empty spaces = characters
     print('three'.count(' '))  # count empty spaces
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 6

4) What does ~'a'.split()~ return?
   #+begin_src python
     result = 'a'.split()
     print(result)
     print(type(result))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : ['a']
   : <class 'list'>

5) How can you split ~'1-2-3'~?
   #+begin_src python
     print('1-2-3'.split('-',3))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : ['1', '2', '3']

6) How can you get 3 as a number from the keyboard and store it as an
   integer variable ~num~?
   #+begin_src python
     num = input('Enter the number 3: ')
     print('num is a string:', isinstance(num,str))
     num = int(num)
     print('num is a integer now:', isinstance(num,int))

- Unicode standard used to represent a characters and symbols ([[https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html][doc]])
- Strings are instances of the ~str~ class, which contains functions
  like ~strip~, ~split~, ~count~ (enter ~dir(str)~ to see all of them.
- To get any function (aka method) that lives 'inside' ~str~ (like a
  tool in a toolbox), use the accessor dot-operator: ~str.split()~.
- To test if a variable ~x~ is an integer or a string, you can use
  ~isinstance(x, int)~ or ~isinstance(x, str)~ (returns Boolean).
- Another way of describing 'object orientation' is to say that
  'everything is an object' and 'objects exchange messages'.
- Operator to convert characters to unicode and back: ~ord~ and ~chr~.
- Building process models: flowcharts, BPMN, UML
- BPMN elements {events, tasks, gateways, participants, flow}, and
  rules {one start/end event per pool, only message flows between and
  only sequence flows inside pools, complete gateway splits, no
  hanging elements}.
- Inserting images and links in Google Colab text cells
- Flow control: Boolean values and operators, comparison operators

*** Machine zero vs mathematical zero

Here is really very nice visualization of the floating-point
representation in computers, which we discussed today:
https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/. The
related section in the Python reference manual is here:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html.

*** Unicode
Here is the [[https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html][Unicode documentation]] from the Python reference
manual. After a short, very readable explanation, you get a bunch of
small examples. Some of the commands we haven't learnt yet (like
~try~ ... ~except~ exception handling, but we'll get there).

     #+attr_latex: :width 300px
     [[../img/bpmn1.png]]  [[../img/bpmn2.png]]
  2) Start with a pool and name it ~Computer~.
  3) Add suitable events and tasks connected by sequence flow.
  4) Take a screenshot. It should look [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/admin/blob/main/RoamNotes/img/py_first.png][like this]].
  5) Add another pool and name it ~User~.
  6) Connect the two pools with suitable (message) flow.
  7) Take another screenshot. It should look [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/admin/blob/main/RoamNotes/img/py_first_user.png][like this]].
  8) Save your diagram as ~.bpmn~ and as ~.svg~ files.
  9) Add your ~.svg~ diagram in a titled Colab text cell:
  10) Upload your diagram to a drive and link to it in the text cell.

** Preview and review

1) What is a 'Pythonista'? Are you one?
   #+begin_quote
   The term describes anyone who is enthusiastic about Python and
   actively engages with the language and with its community. Your
   call!
   #+end_quote

2) Which diagrammatic languages for flow modeling do you know?
   #+begin_quote
   1. BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
   2. UML (Unified Modeling Language)
   3. Flow charts
   #+end_quote

3) What do you have to think of when adding a gateway to a process
   model to model a decision point?
   #+begin_quote
   Unlike in a flowchart, the gateway, once opened, needs to be closed
   again to mark the end of the logical operation. One practical effect
   is that it is easier to remove decisions from processes because
   their beginning and end is clear.
   #+end_quote

4) What's the difference between ~n=1~ and ~n==1~?
   #+begin_quote
   1. ~n=1~ is a statement while ~n==1~ is an expression
   2. ~n=1~ stores 1 in an integer variable ~n~
   3. ~n==1~ compares the value in ~n~ with the value 1
   #+end_quote

5) How can you get ~42 == '42'~ to evaluate to ~True~?
   #+begin_src python :results output
     # By explicitly converting the data types
     print(str(42) == '42')
     print(42 == int('42'))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : True
   : True

6) What is ~42.0 == 42~?
   #+begin_src python
     # There is automatic type coercion from 42 to 42.0
     print(42.0 == 42)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : True

7) What is ~42 == 'meaning of life'~?
   #+begin_src python
     # comparing an integer and a string will always be False
     # since there is no automatic conversion between the two
     print(42 == 'meaning of life')
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : False

8) How can you turn a Unicode point into a character and vice versa?
   #+begin_src python
     # Courtesy Radek
     print(chr(120))
     print(ord('x'))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : x
   : 120

9) How can you check if a variable ~x~ is an integer, float or string?
   #+begin_src python :results output
     x = 42.0
     # these functions check which object class x is an instance of
     print(isinstance(x,float))
     print(isinstance(int(x),int))
     print(isinstance(str(x),str))
     # or you can use type(x)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : True
   : True
   : True

10) How can you check if a value is in a list or not?
    #+begin_src python
      print('a' in ['a','b'])
      print('a' not in ['a','b'])
      print('a' in ['b','c'])
      print('a' not in ['b','c'])
      print(0 in [1, 100, 0])     # etc.
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : True
    : False
    : False
    : True
    : True

[[../img/homework.jpg]]

*** De Morgan's laws revisited

- In class, you showed that De Morgan's laws hold in Python. Now,
  instead of printing ~True~ after each statement,
  1) print only the number of ~True~ statements at the end.
  2) print the final statement using string concatenation
  3) print the final statement using an f-string

- The output could simply look like this:
  #+begin_example org
    Number of True statements: 8
  #+end_example

- *Tip:* Boolean conditions are the core of making decisions. They can
  be put in an ~if~ statement like this:
  #+begin_example python
    if [condition]: [do_something]
  #+end_example

- *Tip:* string concatenation relies on strings being 'added' with
  ~+~. Boolean values ~True~, ~False~ are not strings and need to be
  converted to be concatenated.

- *Tip:* The f-string is recent addition to Python 3. A ~print~ argument
  pre-fixed with an ~f~ can print variables without ~,~ or ~+~
  operators. Instead, variables have to be enclosed in ~{ }~:
  #+begin_src python
    whoami = 'Marcus Birkenkrahe'
    print(f"My name is {whoami}")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : My name is Marcus Birkenkrahe

* DONE Day 8: Loops and breaks (continue'd)

** TODO Preview and review

1) *Python chat:* ~pandas~ is a Python library for data frame creation and
   manipulation. I've created [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JaLBpbFTOuDZzITcYR5TNvsQwiqoFUiT?usp=sharing][this notebook]] to explain how to use it
   to import CSV datasets via URL or as a file. We'll get back to
   ~pandas~.

2) What does a /flow control statement/ consist of?
   #+begin_quote
   - a /condition/ (expression), e.g. ~count == 1~
   - a /clause/ (block of code), e.g. ~count = count + 1~
   #+end_quote

3) Is Python the only programming language with significant
   indentation?
   #+begin_quote
   No. Haskell, COBOL are two other (obscure) high-level languages
   that share this fate, as do many meta-languages (Markdown, Org,
   YAML).
   #+end_quote

4) What are the elements of a conditional block?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Keyword ~if~
   2) Conditional expression
   3) Separator ~:~
   4) Code block starting on the next line
   #+end_quote
   Example:
   #+begin_src python
     import datetime
     now = datetime.datetime.now()
     if now.strftime('%m-%d') == '06-01':
         print('June is here')
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : June is here

5) How would you get the docstring for the method ~now~?
   #+begin_src python
     help(datetime.datetime.now)
   #+end_src

6) Now, travel back through time to the end of yesterday's session:
   1. Create a code block with 3 lines of code.
   2. Assign ~name~ and ~age~ to ~'Carol'~ and ~10~.
   3. If ~name~ is 'Alice' then greet Alice.
   4. Otherwise, greet a stranger.
   5. This is the process you should have created:
      #+attr_latex: :width 400px
      [[../img/py_alice_2.png]]
   6. Now, we'll generalize this to allow for more than one (exclusive)
      alternative by introducing the ~elif~ clause.
   7. Python code:
      #+begin_src python
        name, age = 'Carol', 10
        if name == 'Alice': print('Hi, Alice')
        else: print('Hello, stranger')
      #+end_src
      - If there's only a single statement, Python does not insist on
      indentation! Indentation is for 'proper' blocks (multiline).

- Using ~elif~ with conditional statement to add alternative clauses.
- ~elif~ statements are sensitive to their position in the program.
- The condition of a ~while~ loop needs to be ~True~ to enter the clause.
- Production BPMN diagrams do not have any flow lines looping back.
- ~break~ breaks out of its loop, ~continue~ goes back to the start.
- Use non-Boolean truth values to control ~if~, and ~while~ conditions.
- ~for~ and ~while~ loops are logically fully equivalent: you can always
  turn a ~for~ loop into a ~while~ loop and vice versa.
- The ~range~ function creates a sequence of integer values using its
  ~start~, ~stop~ and ~step~ parameters.

#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: De Dion-Bouton tricycle towing a passenger (ca. 1919)
[[../img/import.jpg]]

** Review and preview (test 2 is coming soon)

1) What's the template for an ~elif~ statement?
   #+begin_quote
   1) ~elif~ keyword
   2) condition that evaluates to ~True~ or ~False~
   3) separator ~:~
   4) indented clause on the next line
   #+end_quote

2) Does it matter when an (alternative) ~elif~ statement occurs?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, because the conditional ~if~ statement is left when the
   condition is satisfied, and no further conditions are checked.
   #+end_quote

3) What type of conditional statement is this and how many conditions
   are being tested?
   #+attr_latex: :width 400px
   [[../img/py_alice_5.png]]
   #+begin_quote
   The BPMN process model describes an ~if~, ~elif~, ~else~ logic that
   tests two conditions:
   1. Is the ~name~ 'Alice'? - if not, check:
   2. Is the ~age~ greater than 12?
   #+end_quote

4) How could you check if the input ~name~ is 'Alice' and if she is not a
   minor by ~age~?
   #+begin_example python
     if name == 'Alice' and int(age) > 18:
   #+end_example

5) When is the message "Get ready to host" below printed if the
   variable ~guests~ is entered as keyboard input?
   #+begin_example python
     if int(guests):
        print('Get ready to host')
     else:
        print('No guests')
   #+end_example
   #+begin_quote
   - The condition needs to be ~True~ for the clause to be entered.
   - For the condition ~int(guests)~ to be ~True~, ~guests~ must *not* be
     '0'. (Empty ~''~ input or floating values raise an exception: ~int~
     can only convert strings that represent integer numbers).
   #+end_quote

6) What type of data does a ~while~ condition evaluate to?
   #+begin_quote
   A Boolean value, ~True~ or ~False~
   #+end_quote

7) What is the difference between ~break~ and ~continue~?
   #+begin_quote
   - ~break~ leaves the current (innermost) clause/loop
   - ~continue~ goes back to the condition for another evaluation
   #+end_quote

8) The variable ~data~ is obtained as keyboard input below. When is the
   ~data~ printed?
   #+begin_src python :results output
     while not data:
         data = input("Data? ")
         continue
     print(data)
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   - The ~while~ condition will remain ~True~ until anything is entered.
   - When anything but the empty string is entered, it is printed.
   #+end_quote

9) What is the difference between ~range(10)~, ~range(0, 10)~, ~range(0,
   10, 1)~ and ~range(9,-1,-1) in a ~for~ loop?
   #+begin_src python
     # range(10) starts at 0 goes to 9
     for i in range(10):
         print(i,end=' ')
         print()
         # range(0,10) starts at 0 goes to 9
     for i in range(0,10):
         print(i,end=' ')
         print()
         # range(0,10,1) starts at 0 goes to 9
     for i in range(0,10):
         print(i,end=' ')
         print()
     for i in range(9,-1,-1):
         print(i,end=' ')
         print()
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

10) How many Boolean operators can you use in a ~for~ loop with ~range~?
    #+begin_quote
    A ~for~ loop with ~range~ has no condition because the 'stop' condition
    has been absorbed by the ~range~ function. If the 'stop' condition is
    reached, the ~for~ loop is left:

- ~range~ function details: ~type~, counting up and down, ~start~, ~stop~ and
  ~step~ (positional) parameters.
- The Python Standard Library contains ca. 200 of the most important
  modules for controlling the environment, like ~os~, ~sys~, ~random~, ~math~.
- There are more than 200,000 Python packages in the PyPl (the
  official Python Package Index) alone. By comparison: R, another
  popular interpreted open source language, has ca. 20,000 packages.
- Modules (aka libraries) must be imported with ~import~, individual
  functions with ~from [module]~. Use ~sys.modules~ to check which modules
  are imported.
- Use ~sys.exit()~ to exit from any part of the program (not just loops).
- Use ~random.randint(a,b)~ for random integers from [a,b]
- Use ~os.getenv~ to check OS environment variables like ~USER~ (you).
- Planning, implementation and extension of a simple 'guess the
  number' game where you guess a random number drawn by the computer.
