I'd\nlike to be able to attend both the visitation and the memorial service\nfor Jason Anderson ([†](https://www.willisfs.com/obituary/Jason-Anderson)) myself tomorrow from 1 pm - 3 pm (Brown\nChapel).\n\nInstead, please work through the remainder of the practice file\n(handout and [here on GitHub](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/blob/main/pdf/0_course_practice.pdf)) **on your own**. Both sessions can be done\nonline from the comfort of your home:\n\n1.  Open a browser with two windows, and work through the exercises for\n    replit.com and DataCamp workspaces line by line.\n2.  Essentially, both environments offer file editor + interactive\n    Python shell + OS shell in one window.\n3.  Replit.com is more like IDLE, while the DataCamp workspace is an\n    interactive notebook like Colab.\n4.  Python-wise, this is essentially \"hello world\" again.\n\nThis shouldn't take more than an hour. Use the remaining time to get\nstarted with your [DataCamp assignments](https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-spring-2023/assignments) (15 chapters in total,\nrequiring no less than 15 hours of practice).\n\nIn the middle of our taking off for flight, it might be worthwhile\nhighlighting some logistics to help you review past sessions if you so\nchoose:\n\n1.  You can find the **session review/test preview** information, and a\n    summary of the last session in the agenda file here in GitHub\n    ([PDF](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/blob/main/pdf/agenda.pdf) or [HTML](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/blob/main/org/agenda.org)).\n2.  You can find all **practice and lecture files** in the PDF directory\n    here in GitHub ([PDF](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/tree/main/pdf) or [HTML](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py/tree/main/org)): I just went through it myself to\n    review today.\n3.  Lastly, photos of the **whiteboard** writings and drawings are\n    available [here in GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IEkIHzieBJ_tS5GPigsCxRZcioanlPof?usp=sharing).\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you on Friday to cover Python\nexpressions, variables and statements with more practice exercises.\n\nAny questions, you know where to find me!\n\nCheers\n\n"

        "Jonathan Tucker: If you need a different Python version for running a\nprogram (that requires a specific version) what application would you\nuse to create this? I need to be able to run the newest version of\nPython and switch between the older version seamlessly.  I'm looking\nat using Conda to give the program its own Python environment (with\nthe correct version), does this make sense?\n\nAnswer: Yes this does make sense. Anaconda may be overkill though -\nyou ought to be aware of the bare metal alternative which is Python's\nvirtualenv. The purpose is not so much to switch between versions fast\nbut to have different environments for your production code. If you're\na lone developer though why not just have different versions on your\nmachine. I do that with R all the time (whenever I upgrade), and R (or\nEmacs) allow me to call upon any version when I want to. So I would\nprobably give virtualenv a try if I had to. Currently, I have 3.11 and\n3.9 on Windows, 3.8 on Ubuntu, but all of them still on the same\nPC. Here is a recent comparison of the two:\n[https://dataaspirant.com/anaconda-python-virtualenv/](https://dataaspirant.com/anaconda-python-virtualenv/). Or what I would\nprobably do is write a shell script that uses one command (python) and\nswitches between different versions. If you use Conda, you will not\nunderstand how it's done. If you use virtualenv, you understand a\nlittle more (it requires knowledge of the file tree at least, and\nenvironment variables), and if you write your own scripts, you're tha\nmaster of the universe :-) (However, if you ask me \"send me that\nscript\" I'd have to do some research first.) Hope this helps.\n\n"
