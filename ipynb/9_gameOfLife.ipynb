        "-   How the program works:\n    1.  `rule30` is a function that takes a list of cells as input and\n        applies Rule 30 to generate the new state of these cells. Rule 30\n        is one of the elementary cellular automaton rules introduced by\n        Stephen Wolfram. It's named \"Rule 30\" because the rule number,\n        30, translates to `00011110` in binary, which dictates the new\n        state for a given triplet of cells.\n    2.  Inside the `rule30` function, a new list called `new_cells` is created\n        to store the new state of the cells.\n    3.  The function then iterates over each cell in the input list\n        (`cells`). For each cell, it determines the state of its left\n        neighbor, itself, and its right neighbor. Based on these states,\n        it computes the new state using the Rule 30 logic: `new_state =\n             left XOR (center OR right)`, where XOR (or `^`) is the bitwise\n        exclusive OR operation.\n    4.  After iterating through all the cells, the function returns the\n        `new_cells` list, which represents the new state of the cells after\n        applying Rule 30.\n    5.  The main part of the program initializes the cells with a\n        specific configuration (11 cells, with the sixth cell being in\n        state 1 and the rest in state 0).\n    6.  The program then runs the cellular automaton for 10 steps. In\n        each step, it prints the current state of the cells as a string\n        of `#` characters for state 1 and spaces for state 0. After\n        printing, it calls the `rule30` function to compute the new state\n        of the cells for the next step.\n    7.  The underscore `_` in the `for` loop is a conventional placeholder or\n        throwaway variable since it is not actually needed anywhere: the\n        loop is there only to execute the clause 10 times.\n    8.  Which *methods* are used in this program?\n\n>      - `list.append`: appends item to list in place\n>      - `str.join`: joins any number of strings\n>      - Other functions: `range`, `len`, `print`.\n\n"
