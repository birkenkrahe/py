This copy is used to store the next state of the grid.\n    -   The nested `for` loops iterate through each cell in the grid. For\n        each cell, the function calculates the total number of live\n        neighbors (dividing by 255 to normalize to 1 for live cells,\n        since live cells are represented by 255 or white).\n    -   It then applies Conway's Game of Life rules to decide whether\n        each cell should be alive or dead in the next state. The\n        changes are stored in `newGrid`.\n    -   `img.set_data(newGrid)` updates the image plot object with the\n        new grid state.\n    -   `grid[:] = newGrid[:]` updates the actual grid with the new\n        state.\n    \n    6.
